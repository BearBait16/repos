    <p>Hi! I'm Jackson! I am a software engineering major at BYUi. I am a huge fan of all things games.
        One of my favorite games of all time is Dungeouns and Dragons. I love sitting around making stories with my
        friends!
    </p>
    <p>
        I've been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints my whole life. I returned from
        my mission in November of last year, after serving in Mesa Arizona. I love the Lord, and I love how much
        closer I get to come to Him on BYUi campus.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm excited to get to know everyone!
