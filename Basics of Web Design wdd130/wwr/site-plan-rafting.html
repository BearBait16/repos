        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>I would like to share information on my favorite subject. Dungeouns and Dragons. This will be some sort of
            information hub for players.</p>
        <!-- change this -->

        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>My main audience is my friends who play DND with me. They are constantly asking me about rules and how to
            apply
            them in game. In the game of Dungeouns and Dragons there are 3 full length textbooks that give you the
            basics. In
            other words, that's a lot of rules. This will not only help them, but any other struggling DM who is
            constatnly needing
            to pause the game to explain the rules. This will be a quick reference for them to study in between,
            or to use in off time while playing. They will often use their tablet or their laptop.
        </p>
